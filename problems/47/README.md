## [<<](../46) Problem 47 [>>](../48)

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that
calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you
can sell it. For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5
dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

Example:

    >>> coding_problem_47([9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10])
    5
